# Goals
- Gain a better understanding of the underlying mathematics behind raytracing and physically based rendering
- Utilize discriminants and vector arithmetic for raycast hit detection
- Allow for dynamic scene adjustment through simple user interface
- Render objects with varying materials
- Render emissive objects
